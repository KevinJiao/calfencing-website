      <h1>About</h1>
      <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing">Fencing</a> is deeply rooted in Cal athletic tradition, with a team existing in some form since the founding of the school (it's the oldest club!).The sport itself dates back much further, and can be counted as one of the longest-practiced combat disciplines in history. Fencing today is a fast-paced and challenging sport at the same time, it is accessible to a wide range of ages and stylistically can be tailored to all levels of athleticism.</p>

      </table>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <h4>I have no experience. Can I join?</h4>
      <p>Yes! All levels are welcome. See <a href="join.html">here</a> for more information.</p>

      <h4>Where is the club?</h4>
      <p>The club operates in the Combatives Room of the Recreational Sports Facility (RSF) at the southwest corner of the UC Berkeley campus, on 2301 Bancroft Way between Dana Street and Ellsworth Street. After entering the RSF, turn left and go past the treadmills to find the Combatives Room right next to the Martial Arts Room.</p>

      <h4>What should I wear? What about equipment?</h4>
      <p>Come in athletic clothing that allows you to move freely. Come to practice wearing long pants, a t-shirt, thick socks, and athletic shoes. Any light shoe will be fine, but the flatter the sole the better. Note: Long pants (sweat pants, warmups, etc.) or knickers are mandatory for all fencers. For beginners, we have all the gear you will need. Those who already own gear can bring it and store it in the club armory.</p>

      <h4>Does it hurt?</h4>
      <p>Though it may look dangerous, fencing is one of the safest sports around, and is often said to be safer than golf!</p>

      <h4>How much are dues?</h4>
      <p>Cost shouldn't keep you from fencing at Berkeley - dues are $120 per semester or $190 for an entire academic year, which is an awesome deal when many private clubs charge over $100 a month.</p>

      <h4>Can I take fencing for units?</h4>
      <p>Yes! We have a <a href="decal.html">DeCal.</a></p>

      <h4>Is there fencing tonight?</h4>
      <p><a href="http://istherefencingtonight.com/">http://istherefencingtonight.com/</a></p>
      <p>If it's broken or wrong, blame Stephen Pon.</p>


      <h4>Why is practice so late?</h4>
      <p>Apparently, aerobics and hip hop dance are cooler than fencing...but the later practices are really not as bad as they sound. If you're concerned about the late walk home, there are groups of people going in all directions after practice. Talk to an officer to help find someone going the same way.</p>

      <h4>Where can I learn more?</h4>
      <p>The USFA (United States Fencing Association) is our main governing body. They have excellent resources for fencers of all ages. Additionally, questions can be sent to our <a href="contact.html">officers</a>.</p>
