She doesn't find the parry — she swings at the air — because the attack has been withheld. <br><br> For many fencers who use this technique without thinking, this could be called a bad habit. The moment it gets predictable, it's a severe liability. Used here, and at this moment, it's a very sophisticated and effective way of disjoining hand tempo and foot tempo.<br><br></p>  <a name="verylate"></a><h2>Very, very late arriving attack</h2> <center><EMBED  							SRC="videos/foil/Very_late_arr_att.mov"  							WIDTH="240" HEIGHT="196"  							AUTOPLAY="false"  							CONTROLLER="true"  							TARGET="myself"  							PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">  						</EMBED> </center> <p>Just to mix things up, you can play with the signals you're giving to your opponent. <br><br> Here, fencer left showed a concluded attack to her opponent — the lunge was launched, the lunge landed.

The opponent took another few parries, but they were all guesswork. <br><br> Of course, this approach is dangerous when the opponent is not ready to be fooled.<br><br>Also note — when the extension finally comes from the left, it's very fast.

(The leaning is what does it, it removes her options for a counter-action.)<br><br>  Fencer right is really inviting her opponent. Having drawn a quickly thrown-together and badly constructed attack from her opponent, she picks up an easy parry riposte.<br><br>  This action is also under Decision Point marching — marches are invitations.</p>|||14||||

This is what makes <i>esquives</i> so useful.<br><br>  In this action, fencer right counters into the attack, but further complicates her opponent's point control by displacing her target. Fencer left, committing to her attack early, couldn't change targets and hit the back.<br><br>  Fencer right's timing is either very precise or very lucky. <i>Or</i> it's habitual — in which case you can invite the counter and finish on the back.<br><br></p>  <a name="tall"></a><h2>Against tall opponents</h2> <center><EMBED  							SRC="videos/foil/Against_tall_opp.mov"  							WIDTH="240" HEIGHT="196"  							AUTOPLAY="false"  							CONTROLLER="true"  							TARGET="myself"  							PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">  						</EMBED> </center> <p>Against people with longer reach, you have to really, really make a feeling of surprise.<br><br>  Here, fencer left launches a good surprise attack.

This, however, is a wonderful example of a German hesitation attack from the late 80's, still used today.<br><br>  Some of its effectiveness is due to its tempo: During the defender's best parrying time, the attacker's blade is nowhere to be found because it's pulled back to the hip. The defender is left swishing at the air with their blade. The point lands <i>after</i> the parry.<br><br>  This attack also works because of the upwards angle of approach of the tip. By starting in the low-line and traveling up to the high-line, the attacker nullifies low-line parries and gets his tip closer to the target before a high-line parry would intersect the blade. A low-line parry that scoops the blade to high-line (such as a flying 7) would still allow the tip to get close to target.<br><br>  These attacks are fun to do, and easy to hit with, but be careful — they're addictive! If you build all your attacks around this rhythm, you'll be impotent against the first fencer who knows about hesitation parries.<br><br>  <i>Defending against</i>: Unless you're surprised, you can attack into preparation with a fast direct extension, and run away before the opponent's tip comes forward. This sort of attack brings the attacker's target close, while their arm is pulling back.</p>|||14||||

One fencer has already tied himself into the action, and the other hasn't. One is intense and direct, the other isn't. Both fencers are taking the action seriously, but one is much more serious than the other.<br><br>{nl}When the fencers get within hitting distance, fencer left makes a compound attack — an inside-to-outside feint attack with a step lunge. According to the tactical wheel, the way to defeat a feint attack is to attack direct (it's the action where the wheel rolls back to the beginning). And that's what fencer right does. He darts forward, achieving such a complete surprise that fencer left can't even put a light on.<br><br>{nl}Change in speed <i>is</i> tempo, it's the essence of surprise. Fencer right's attack is much faster than his prior advances. By advancing at a normal speed, he gave no indication to his opponent of what was to come. Fencer left has no premonition of danger, so his intensity doesn't elevate, and his hand never goes into the fast reflexive mode that hard-pressed fencers use to defend themselves.<br><br>{nl}If fencer right had tipped off his opponent that this was a "serious" action, his simple attack might not have worked. A tense arm, jerky footwork, fast advances — any of these would have put fencer left into a defensive frame of mind. But fencer right <i>didn't</i> tip off his opponent; he went slow-fast and earned a decisive touch.<br><br></p>{nl}{nl}<a name="open"></a><h2>Opening the opponent for delivery</h2>{nl}<center><EMBED {nl}							SRC="videos/foil/Open_opponent.mov" {nl}							WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="322" {nl}							AUTOPLAY="false" {nl}							CONTROLLER="true" {nl}							TARGET="myself" {nl}							PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"> {nl}						</EMBED> </center>{nl}<p>This action appears to feature a byzantine series of feints on the part of the near fencer. While it looks complicated and difficult, we're only seeing what the opponent is seeing.<br><br>{nl}Follow the nearer fencer's hand (not his blade) to see how simple his action really is. He is making a circular scoop motion, followed by a fast extension. Done in front of a mirror, it would seem unexceptional. What makes it work so effectively is that his opponent so completely buys into it. The far fencer, expecting a more definitive, direct action, is left searching for the blade, and never finds it until it's too late. He probably wishes he'd pulled distance.<br><br>{nl}Also — sometimes an opponent will forget to move while they're trying to find parries. This is called rooting to the ground, and it happens because the opponent's mind has been so suddenly engaged with a blade problem that they forget the distance problem. In this action, fencer right, who was moving quite easily before the attack, froze on the spot and tried to find the parry. Experiment with different opponents, and find the ones which root when you give them a few disengages.<br><br></p>{nl}{nl}<a name="prep"></a><h2>Attack in preparation</h2>{nl}<center><EMBED {nl}							SRC="videos/foil/attack_preparation.mov" {nl}							WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="322" {nl}							AUTOPLAY="false" {nl}							CONTROLLER="true" {nl}							TARGET="myself" {nl}							PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"> {nl}						</EMBED> </center>{nl}<p>Fencer left starts an action, fencer right attacks into it.<br><br>{nl}{nl}Attacks into preparation are reactive, because they are launched when the opponent is already doing something threatening. Many fencing newcomers (and not so newcomers) confuse attacks into preparation with counter-attacks, because they can look and feel the same, and they accomplish the same things.<br><br>{nl}{nl}A <i>counter-attack</i> is an attack on an attack, and it gets no Right of Way because the attack already has priority. An <i>attack into preparation</i> is an attack on something that might become an attack but isn't yet; it does get Right of Way, because it's the only attack in the action.<br><br>{nl}{nl}Still, attacks into preparation have a "gotcha" feel like successful counter-attacks. They rely on the opponent to bring their target to your tip, so all you have to worry about is predicting the right time to attack. To be good at predicting, you must find ways that your opponent is predictable.<br><br>{nl}{nl}Many fencers always prepare their attacks the same way: They might make a galloping advance, or they might swish the blade, or they might only shift their weight forward. Keep an eye out for these tell-tale signs, and see what an attack at those moments (even a false attack) can do.<br><br>{nl}{nl}If your opponent isn't preparing much, then that means they're probably content to hit you with simple direct attacks. What's the story with that!? Start moving! When you use distance to your advantage, the opponent will have to work harder to hit you. They can't just lunge and finish the action. To get you in distance for their attacks, they'll have to move you back and forth, distract you with the blade, and do a few feints — and these are all preparations.</p>|||14||||

Not really.<br><br>  But with foil at least, the fencer with priority is very safe from being scored against (assuming they finish with a hit). As long as you're attacking, and certain things don't happen (like a parry), you're safe. The opponent must block the attack, or wait for it to otherwise finish, before they can create a Right of Way threat against you. <br><br> So a short, fast and simple attack is quite safe; all you have to do is turn on a light (any light). Only if the attack is slow, compound, or has preparations do you have to worry about the integrity of the attack, because then, the opponent has an opportunity to try to mess it up.

A fencer in a lunge is also uniquely at risk, since they have no mobility and are stuck with their feet far apart.<br><br> Despite how uneconomical the lunge is, it's worth it. With a lunge at the right time, the risk is minimized, and the energy used is much lower than a dozen corps-a-corps actions to achieve the same thing (a point).<br><br> Fencer right lunges, hits, and is completely safe. Her opponent wanted to get away, but couldn't move fast enough. When she saw she couldn't get enough distance, she tried to parry riposte — but an en garde fencer's reach is nothing like a lunging fencer's reach. This is why fencers invented the lunge in the first place.<br><br></p>{nl}<a name="tempo"></a><h2>Tempo to launch attack</h2>{nl}<center><EMBED {nl}							SRC="videos/foil/Tempo_attack.mov" {nl}							WIDTH="240" HEIGHT="196" {nl}							AUTOPLAY="false" {nl}							CONTROLLER="true" {nl}							TARGET="myself" {nl}							PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"> {nl}						</EMBED> </center>{nl}<p>After some jockeying and distance work, fencer right feels it's time to attack. <i>Uh-oh!</i> Fencer left has already felt the timing, and launched her attack a tempo ahead.<br><br>{nl}Even the simplest and most direct actions can be trumped this way, by the sense of time.<br><br>{nl}Note how fencer left added an unneccessary step before her final lunge. Fencer right was doubtless trained to perceive this accident as a launch-time. If you're in lunge distance, and the opponent makes a preparatory action, you can start your attack and own priority.

The hand movements during a march are implied threats, not immediate threats. A raised hand can imply a back flick, a sideways hand can imply a chest flick. While marching, a fencer will move their hand from position to position to help keep the opponent in a reactionary, defensive mode.<br><br>  In this action, fencer left wants none of that. Perhaps he's been studying his opponent, and recognizes this as a favored attack. When the hand goes up, fencer left gets ready. When the body is brought forward (into the defender's <i>decision point</i>) his clear decision is to stop-hit fencer right.<br><br>  After a stop-hit, it's a very good idea to get away quickly. You don't want your opponent to turn on a light, and confuse the director. If you can't get away without being hit, then possibly your stop-hit wasn't quite timely enough.<br><br>  Fencer left pulls distance, and his opponent's slow-to-finish attack completely misses target.

He doesn't do anything special, he just gives ground and waits for the reveal.<br><br>  The reveal is the point in every attack when the real goal is made clear. For simple attacks, the reveal happens early, because the defender isn't supposed to be able to do anything about it. For longer attacks, the reveal comes at the end, after a whole lot of misinformation is communicated and the defender (hopefully) has completely lost composure.<br><br>  When fencer right reveals his desired target (high outside), fencer left is ready. He's kept his hand calm and unflinching through the early part of the attack, so he's prepared with a demolishing parry 4 and a methodically placed riposte.<br><br>  Marches, with their feints and long-developing <i>trompements</i>, are designed to keep this sort of thing from happening. But this doesn't mean it can't happen, especially if a prepared defender wants it to happen. Also, the march wasn't all that complicated; if fencer right had finished with a false attack instead of a real one he could have done a second-intention counter-parry.</p>|||16||||
