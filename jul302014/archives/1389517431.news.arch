Or, it could be attack from left, counter attack. For our needs, we'll call it attack from right.<br><br>{nl}{nl}Close-outs are hybrid actions that go against the normal flow of bladework. Usually, a blade is either defending or attacking. Very occasionally, it can do both.<br><br>{nl}{nl}In this action, fencer right attacks (or counter-attacks), while at the same time forcing the opponent's blade away from his target. It's not quite a prise de fer, which is (by definition) a preparation of attack, but it's almost the same thing. It would have been one if the action hadn't finished so quickly, but it did, so it gets its own name: the close-out.<br><br>{nl}{nl}The close-out works best like any bind, when the strong part of your blade is against the weak part of the opponent's blade. When the opponent's blade is extended in line, as for an attack, it offers enough resistance so that you can catch it near your bell guard and slide along the blade back towards the opponent's target. Hence that short, metallic "slurp" sound.<br><br></p>{nl}{nl}<a name="reallysimple"></a><h2>Simple attacks are simple</h2>{nl}<center><EMBED {nl}							SRC="videos/foil/make_it_look_easy1.mov" {nl}							WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="322" {nl}							AUTOPLAY="false" {nl}							CONTROLLER="true" {nl}							TARGET="myself" {nl}							PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"> {nl}						</EMBED> </center>{nl}<p>Every now and then, simple attacks are <i>really simple.</i> After a fencer has practiced committed attacks and hesitation attacks, fast and slow attacks, safe and risky attacks&#8230; after they've run the gamut, and practiced everything, they should remind themselves that attacks are about hitting the opponent. It is very easy to get caught up in the attack itself, and to see a good attack as the goal.<br><br>{nl}{nl}It's not the kitchen, it's the food.<br>{nl}It's not the music, it's the mood.<br><br>{nl}{nl}For attacks, the real goal is putting the point on the opponent. If you don't have to pop a tendon, or even break a sweat while doing it, so be it.<br><br>{nl}{nl}In this action, fencer left advances towards his opponent. He doesn't look like he's in close distance, due in part to his raised hand. When he extends, he extends very close to his opponent's blade. Note the blade-sound as his opponent actually finds the parry and begins to move the tip away from his target. But it's too late — the distance is too close, and fencer left's tip is traveling forward faster than the parry is pushing it sideways. The result is a neat little touch, with very little sweat.{nl}<br><br>{nl}This is just one touch, but at the right time, a simple attack like this can cause a spike in the defender's mental activity. He may think anything from, <i>I'm a fool!</i> to <i>What was I thinking?</i> to even, <i>Gee that guy is good!</i> While they're trying to pinpoint their feelings about what happened, the attacker gets a quiet glow of pride. A secondary goal, then, is to make everything you do look easy: It makes your opponent afraid, or at least a little morbid about their chances against you.<br><br></p>{nl}{nl}<a name="beatgo"></a><h2>Beat-and-go simple attack</h2>{nl}<center>{nl}<EMBED {nl}							SRC="videos/foil/simple_attack_gallop.mov" {nl}							WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="322" {nl}							AUTOPLAY="false" {nl}							CONTROLLER="true" {nl}							TARGET="myself" {nl}							PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"> {nl}						</EMBED> </center>{nl}<p>Fencer left gallops forward, gets into distance and makes a beat attack. <i>So what?</i><br><br>{nl}{nl}There are similar looking attacks under Marching attacks, but this one has a different philosophical foundation. Generally speaking, marches are to get the opponent to make the wrong reaction. Simple attacks are to deprive the opponent of the <i>chance</i> to react. In Short march for longer lunge, for example, fencer left beats the blade, pauses for her opponent to make an early parry, and then hits on the other side. In <i>this</i> action, fencer left beats with the intent to hit <i>before</i> the opponent can do anything at all.{nl}<br><br>{nl}This attack is also interesting because — as normal as it seems — simple beat attacks are not very common in low- and intermediate-level fencing. Study fencers at the lower level, and you'll see many beats that have no follow-up extensions at all, or beats followed by a pullback of the hand (there's some of that in this action). When extensions happen, they are late, or slow, or ambiguous about target, as if the fencer didn't have the target already selected prior to the beat.<br><br>{nl}{nl}Crummy beat-attacks happen for many reasons. The fencer might be beating, and then looking to see what target was opened. The fencer's beat might have been made with the whole arm (rather than just a spank of the blade originating from the wrist), and so it takes a while to bring the point back around to target. Or the fencer might simply have no confidence in the felicity of a beat-and-go, because&#8230; well&#8230; it's so simple, how could it work?{nl}<br><br>{nl}Eventually, every newcomer figures out that fencing isn't about complex actions, but rather simple actions. The simple actions score the points, and few things are simpler than a beat attack. Sure, fencing is complex, but the complexity is built out of simple things, like a house is built out of bricks.</p>|||14||||
