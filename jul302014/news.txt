Since this August, we have shared the sport fencing with hundreds of students, continued the long Berkeley fencing tradition, competed as a team at two tournaments, and enjoyed many fun social events. With individual hard work and Coach Abdul's training, our advanced and novice fencers have taken home seven golds, three silvers, and one bronze from the NCIFL tournaments. Congratulations on a very successful semester! <br /><br />[RRR WEEK ACTIVITIES] This week we have several fun activities to end your semester with your fencing friends! Even if you haven't been able to make it to practice recently, we hope to get the chance to see you at some of our events! <br />Tuesday, 6pm: End of Semester Banquet at Barney's. Even if you can't make it right at 6, please do drop by anytime to have a snack, drink, or dessert! This is a chance for us to socialize in non-athletic apparel so dress in classy attire (or whatever you're comfortable in)! Please bring cash to make splitting the check easier. <br />Wednesday, 9pm: Karaoke! Meet in front of the RSF to carpool to Jaguar . If you have a car and would be willing to drive some people, we would really appreciate it! Be sure to get dinner beforehand. There isn't much food available around there late at night. Bring around $5 to cover the cost. <br />Thursday, 7pm: Capture the Flag. Meet by the Campanile to play the glow-in-the-dark version of the classic Cal Fencing tradition. Since you probably don't want to play on an empty stomach, make sure to have a snack beforehand. After a few rounds, we plan on getting some food together so bring some spending money if you'd like to eat after! <br /><br />[EBFG HOLIDAY POTLUCK] Coach Abdul has invited all Cal fencers to the East Bay Fencers Gym holiday potluck on Saturday 12/21 at 6pm! The event will be at EBFG (1429 Martin Luther King Jr Way, Oakland, CA 94612) so we'll get the chance to see the gym, visit Abdul and our East Bay friends, and meet fencers of all ages. This is a potluck so please remember to represent Cal Fencing well by bringing food to share.<br /><br />[DECAL] In the spring, the Cal Fencing DeCal will be returning after a six year hiatus! This is a great chance for students to get an introduction to the sport and the club while earning units. Be sure to spread the word to your friends!

Abdul has stated that he wishes for all long-term advanced fencers to own and maintain their own personal equipment, including blades and bodycords and jackets. Unfortunately, we can no longer provide the $5 per session electric equipment loan we previously offered, and if you intend to fence here at Cal for more than a semester, you will have to get your own; those who don't will have to fence dry.<br /><br />We are, however, going to be making a group trip to either Alliance in SanFrancisco or Victory Fencing in Millbrae, so this will be an excellent opportunity to purchase your own gear if you are lacking. This trip will occur soon, look out for more details! &#124;<br /><br /><b> Current destination = Victory Fencing </b><br /><b>Current expected date = Friday September 27, around noon. </b><br />If we hit the $2000 mark, there will be a 20% discount.<br />Around $260 to fully equip a person.<br /><br />If you are not going to be in Berkeley for a long period of time (eg you are a transfer student or are an international student), speak to me about setting up an appropriate semester-equipment loan.

Practice on Monday is Cancelled!<p> In case you didn't already know, there is no class on Monday so practice is also cancelled. Obviously, this means we will not be holding the practice novice tournament before the tournament. That's okay, we have more! <p> 2. Novices Invited to Wednesday Practice!<p> Hey novices, if you're planning on going to the tournament, you are invited to get some last minute bouts on Wednesday at 10:30 PM. I know it's a little late, but it's worth it! <p> 3. Pre-register for the Tournament!<p> Save yourself $5. Save me some stress. Pre-register ASAP!  <p>Link: http://askfred.net/Events/moreInfo.php?tournament_id=20577 <p> 4. Tournament Details <p> The tournament is next Saturday (November 17th) at UC Santa Cruz! If you pre-register, the cost is $15, so bring cash. We'll also be trapped there all day so do bring yourself some food. We'll be celebrating with an appropriately large meal afterwards! The cars will be leaving from the RSF on Saturday morning and returning at night. Any cars with novices will be leaving at 6:30 AM (I know it's early, but you can check Google maps!). <p> 5. Ride Arrangements to the Tournament <p> As of now, we have four cars driving to the tournament. We need to carry fencers and equipment in these! If you can drive, please let me know so you can fill out a DMV form. If you are planning on going (driving or need a ride), please place your name in the document below.

1273114014|fencing|Concepts|There are a few general concepts that constantly appear at the higher levels, and which keep fencing fun. More importantly, they stave off <i>frustration</i>. Frustration is what you feel when you know you could've done better. A few simple rules of thumb can give you points you would not have otherwise earned, or at least make you sure you tried your best.<br /><br /><pre><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></pre>|||22|||use_html=1|
1273113947|fencing|Point in Line|The Point in Line is the action we all want to love, but it always lets us down at the end and leaves us alone at the restaurant, trying to look like we want it that way. We've all gotten a few touches with it,  but probably more than a few opponents have taken our lines and rammed them down our throats. It's never clear whether we're using the line, or the line is using us.  Also unhelpful is the fact that the rules are vague in regards to the line. The arm must be extended and the tip "threatening target", but for how long? What are the feet doing? When does the extension become a line? What do directors want? These discussions, once started, are hard to stop.<br><br>  The best way to think of the Point in Line is as a double-edged sword&hellip; or better, a double-tipped weapon. It can be a threat to your opponent, but it can also be a threat to you. Because while using the line, your goal is transparent, you're usually immobile, and your arm is straight: You're singularly exposed to your opponent.<br><br>  Tactically, the Point in Line works like a house with a sign that says: "This house protected by a home security alarm." It puts the fear on the opponent, it slows them down, it makes them stop and open their burgular's bag to pull out the anti-alarm tools. As a fencer, this is usually all you need, and you can use the hesitation to take over the attack or get away, whatever you need.<br><br>  And, every so often, it works.<br /><pre><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></pre>|||20|||use_html=1|
1273113830|fencing|Tricks, Tactics, Strategies|The words "tricks," "tactics" and "strategy" mean different things, and indicate different skills in fencing.<br><br>Generally, <b>strategies</b> are general approaches to a problem, and <b>tactics</b> are more concrete and specific attempts to solve the problem. Strategies are what fencers think about when hooking up against an opponent they are familiar with; tactics are screamed from the sidelines by coaches. A fencer's distance strategy for a bout might be to "Keep long distance and hit with fleches," but the fencer's tactics might be a panoply of glides, stepped-fleches, false retreats, or other combinations, all used in the service of that strategy.<br><br><br /><b>Tricks</b>, on the other hand, don't have such a reputable intellectual pedigree. Tricks are typically unthoughtful, rehearsed actions. Fencers use tricks on an opponent based on their past success with fencers like the opponent. Tricks don't care about which opponent they're used against, the opponents are secondary. What makes tricks hit is the fencer's ability to surprise with them, and his or her comfort with executing them. There is also usually a bit of luck involved.<br /><pre><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></pre>|||21|||use_html=1|
1273113666|fencing|Flicks|Some fencers hate flicks, simply <i>hate</i> them. You might as well hate the ocean. Flicks don't care if you hate them -- they simply score on you.<br><br>Flicks come in all shapes and sizes, behave very much like coups, and can be blocked easily using Sabre-style parries. This doesn't make them less frustrating for the recipients, or less painful when delivered by new fencers. In late 2004/early 2005, some changes to the Foil Rules by the FIE might make flicks more difficult, but they won't go away. If epee is any indication, flicks will still be possible.<br><br>The important thing about the flick is that it is situational, it works best given the proper distance, target position, and timing.<br><br>With straight extensions, if you extend your blade and walk towards the opponent, you will eventually hit them. This is not true of the flick;it requires a finishing hand move to bring the point to bear on the opponent's target. Until the flick is actually traveling to target, it is a <i>vague</i> threat and not an <i>immediate</i> threat. This factor allows good opponents to stop-hit against flick, and it causes not-so-good opponents to <i>think</i> they can stop-hit (and then complain to the director). Directors, by and large, give the flick the same protection as a coupe or cutover: Unless there is egregious multi-tempo pulling of the hand, the flick is considered a continuous threat to the target, because, well, it hit, didn't it?<br><br>Importantly,  the flick bends the blade and requires an elevated hand: Your distance is much closer to hit with a flick than with a point attack. On the other hand, the flick is <i>much </i>more forgiving than a straight extension if you accidentally get too close.|||19|||use_html=1|

They have nothing else going for them  no preparations and no deceptions. The problem is this: The better fencers get, the more difficult it is to surprise them.<br><br>  When you can't surprise an opponent, you can still penetrate their defenses by steadily applying pressure and forcing them to lose their composure. This is what marches do. They wear down defensive opponents, and create openings that can be exploited. <br><br> Fencers attacking with the march must always bring themselves closer to the opponent, constantly forcing the opponent back. Bladework during a march is simplistic and dumbed-down  giant feints, withdrawn hands, swishy blade movements with a bent arm. When marches succeed or fail, they do so on the basis of footwork, not bladework. <br><br> Reasons to march:<br>- You can't get to the opponent with simple attacks<br>- To get into closer distance, or generate opportunities<br>- To invite an attack on the preparation and score with second intention<br>- To shatter the opponent's composure or demoralize him/her<br>- To keep the opponent from marching<br>- To finish the march as a march, and score a point<br><br> <b>Textbook:</b></p> <table class="w"><tr><td><a href="longattacks.php?start_from=1&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=&#open">March to open the opponent up</a><br><a href="longattacks.php?start_from=1&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=&#safemarch">Marches make for safe attacks</a></td><td><a href="longattacks.php?start_from=1&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=&#marchdown">March them down like dogs</a><br><a href="longattacks.php?start_from=1&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=&#oldschool">The old-school march</a></td></tr></table><p><br><b>Variations:</b></p> <table class="w"><tr><td><a href="longattacks.php?start_from=2&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=&#shortmarch">Short march for longer lunge</a><br><a href="longattacks.php?start_from=2&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=&#targetmarch">Changing targets on the march</a><br><a href="longattacks.php?start_from=3&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=&#marchlunge">March for longer lunge 2</a></td><td><a href="longattacks.php?start_from=2&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=&#tempomarch">Changing tempo to finish the march</a><br><a href="longattacks.php?start_from=3&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=&#looong">Looong marching attack</a><br><a href="longattacks.php?start_from=3&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=&#distancemarch">Short march for distance</a></td></tr></table><p><br>Marches have also been called "long attacks," "compound attacks," and "chases."<br><br></p>  <h2>Beating marches</h2> <p>Marching attacks are used because they're immensely successful.

However, this is not to imply that ripostes are machinelike and thoughtless. There are several tactical variations on parries and ripostes -- opposition, detached/beat, interception, ceding, flying, and destroying parries, and then the direct and indirect ripostes. With enough time, fencers can intuitively use the perfect combination for any situation (or perfect one combination for <i>every </i>situation). The key thing about every parry and riposte is that the fencer <i>must stay calm</i>.<br><br>During an action, the attacking fencer has all the options. They can give false signals, they can indicate their target and then change, they can pick any point on the opponent's huge target surface to hit with their little wand of surgical steel. The defender has a harder time of it. Forced into a reactionary mode, they must pick out the real attack from a series of threats, move their blade to it, and block it.

Not really.<br><br>  But with foil at least, the fencer with priority is very safe from being scored against (assuming they finish with a hit). As long as you're attacking, and certain things don't happen (like a parry), you're safe. The opponent must block the attack, or wait for it to otherwise finish, before they can create a Right of Way threat against you. <br><br> So a short, fast and simple attack is quite safe; all you have to do is turn on a light (any light). Only if the attack is slow, compound, or has preparations do you have to worry about the integrity of the attack, because then, the opponent has an opportunity to try to mess it up.

A fencer in a lunge is also uniquely at risk, since they have no mobility and are stuck with their feet far apart.<br><br> Despite how uneconomical the lunge is, it's worth it. With a lunge at the right time, the risk is minimized, and the energy used is much lower than a dozen corps-a-corps actions to achieve the same thing (a point).<br><br> Fencer right lunges, hits, and is completely safe. Her opponent wanted to get away, but couldn't move fast enough. When she saw she couldn't get enough distance, she tried to parry riposte  but an en garde fencer's reach is nothing like a lunging fencer's reach. This is why fencers invented the lunge in the first place.<br><br></p><br /><a name="tempo"></a><h2>Tempo to launch attack</h2><br /><center><EMBED SRC="videos/foil/Tempo_attack.mov" <br />WIDTH="240" HEIGHT="196" <br />AUTOPLAY="false" <br />CONTROLLER="true" <br />TARGET="myself" <br />PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"> <br />						</EMBED> </center><br /><p>After some jockeying and distance work, fencer right feels it's time to attack. <i>Uh-oh!</i> Fencer left has already felt the timing, and launched her attack a tempo ahead.<br><br><br />Even the simplest and most direct actions can be trumped this way, by the sense of time.<br><br><br />Note how fencer left added an unneccessary step before her final lunge. Fencer right was doubtless trained to perceive this accident as a launch-time. If you're in lunge distance, and the opponent makes a preparatory action, you can start your attack and own priority. However, there was no doubt in the director's mind, attack from left.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a name="speed"></a><h2>Change in speed</h2><br /><center><EMBED SRC="videos/foil/tempo_to_hit.mov" <br />WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="322" <br />AUTOPLAY="false" <br />CONTROLLER="true" <br />TARGET="myself" <br />PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"> <br />						</EMBED> </center><br /><p>The director calls "Fence!" and both fencers step forward. One fencer has already tied himself into the action, and the other hasn't. One is intense and direct, the other isn't. Both fencers are taking the action seriously, but one is much more serious than the other.<br><br><br />When the fencers get within hitting distance, fencer left makes a compound attack  an inside-to-outside feint attack with a step lunge. According to the tactical wheel, the way to defeat a feint attack is to attack direct (it's the action where the wheel rolls back to the beginning). And that's what fencer right does. He darts forward, achieving such a complete surprise that fencer left can't even put a light on.<br><br><br />Change in speed <i>is</i> tempo, it's the essence of surprise. Fencer right's attack is much faster than his prior advances. By advancing at a normal speed, he gave no indication to his opponent of what was to come. Fencer left has no premonition of danger, so his intensity doesn't elevate, and his hand never goes into the fast reflexive mode that hard-pressed fencers use to defend themselves.<br><br><br />If fencer right had tipped off his opponent that this was a "serious" action, his simple attack might not have worked. A tense arm, jerky footwork, fast advances  any of these would have put fencer left into a defensive frame of mind. But fencer right <i>didn't</i> tip off his opponent; he went slow-fast and earned a decisive touch.<br><br></p><br /><br /><a name="open"></a><h2>Opening the opponent for delivery</h2><br /><center><EMBED SRC="videos/foil/Open_opponent.mov" <br />WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="322" <br />AUTOPLAY="false" <br />CONTROLLER="true" <br />TARGET="myself" <br />PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"> <br />						</EMBED> </center><br /><p>This action appears to feature a byzantine series of feints on the part of the near fencer. While it looks complicated and difficult, we're only seeing what the opponent is seeing.<br><br><br />Follow the nearer fencer's hand (not his blade) to see how simple his action really is. He is making a circular scoop motion, followed by a fast extension. Done in front of a mirror, it would seem unexceptional. What makes it work so effectively is that his opponent so completely buys into it. The far fencer, expecting a more definitive, direct action, is left searching for the blade, and never finds it until it's too late. He probably wishes he'd pulled distance.<br><br><br />Also  sometimes an opponent will forget to move while they're trying to find parries. This is called rooting to the ground, and it happens because the opponent's mind has been so suddenly engaged with a blade problem that they forget the distance problem. In this action, fencer right, who was moving quite easily before the attack, froze on the spot and tried to find the parry. Experiment with different opponents, and find the ones which root when you give them a few disengages.<br><br></p><br /><br /><a name="prep"></a><h2>Attack in preparation</h2><br /><center><EMBED SRC="videos/foil/attack_preparation.mov" <br />WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="322" <br />AUTOPLAY="false" <br />CONTROLLER="true" <br />TARGET="myself" <br />PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"> <br />						</EMBED> </center><br /><p>Fencer left starts an action, fencer right attacks into it.<br><br><br /><br />Attacks into preparation are reactive, because they are launched when the opponent is already doing something threatening. Many fencing newcomers (and not so newcomers) confuse attacks into preparation with counter-attacks, because they can look and feel the same, and they accomplish the same things.<br><br><br /><br />A <i>counter-attack</i> is an attack on an attack, and it gets no Right of Way because the attack already has priority. An <i>attack into preparation</i> is an attack on something that might become an attack but isn't yet; it does get Right of Way, because it's the only attack in the action.<br><br><br /><br />Still, attacks into preparation have a "gotcha" feel like successful counter-attacks. They rely on the opponent to bring their target to your tip, so all you have to worry about is predicting the right time to attack. To be good at predicting, you must find ways that your opponent is predictable.<br><br><br /><br />Many fencers always prepare their attacks the same way: They might make a galloping advance, or they might swish the blade, or they might only shift their weight forward. Keep an eye out for these tell-tale signs, and see what an attack at those moments (even a false attack) can do.<br><br><br /><br />If your opponent isn't preparing much, then that means they're probably content to hit you with simple direct attacks. What's the story with that!? Start moving! When you use distance to your advantage, the opponent will have to work harder to hit you. They can't just lunge and finish the action. To get you in distance for their attacks, they'll have to move you back and forth, distract you with the blade, and do a few feints  and these are all preparations.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><a name="counter"></a><h2>Counter-attack against simple attacks</h2> <center><EMBED  							SRC="videos/foil/Counter_with_esquive.mov"  							WIDTH="240" HEIGHT="196"  							AUTOPLAY="false"  							CONTROLLER="true"  							TARGET="myself"  							PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">  						</EMBED> </center> <p>There are few things to do against simple attacks, apart from taking the expected parry riposte.

Fencer left, committing to her attack early, couldn't change targets and hit the back.<br><br>  Fencer right's timing is either very precise or very lucky. <i>Or</i> it's habitual  in which case you can invite the counter and finish on the back.<br><br></p>  <a name="tall"></a><h2>Against tall opponents</h2> <center><EMBED  							SRC="videos/foil/Against_tall_opp.mov"  							WIDTH="240" HEIGHT="196"  							AUTOPLAY="false"  							CONTROLLER="true"  							TARGET="myself"  							PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">  						</EMBED> </center> <p>Against people with longer reach, you have to really, really make a feeling of surprise.<br><br>  Here, fencer left launches a good surprise attack.

This, however, is a wonderful example of a German hesitation attack from the late 80's, still used today.<br><br>  Some of its effectiveness is due to its tempo: During the defender's best parrying time, the attacker's blade is nowhere to be found because it's pulled back to the hip. The defender is left swishing at the air with their blade. The point lands <i>after</i> the parry.<br><br>  This attack also works because of the upwards angle of approach of the tip. By starting in the low-line and traveling up to the high-line, the attacker nullifies low-line parries and gets his tip closer to the target before a high-line parry would intersect the blade. A low-line parry that scoops the blade to high-line (such as a flying 7) would still allow the tip to get close to target.<br><br>  These attacks are fun to do, and easy to hit with, but be careful  they're addictive! If you build all your attacks around this rhythm, you'll be impotent against the first fencer who knows about hesitation parries.<br><br>  <i>Defending against</i>: Unless you're surprised, you can attack into preparation with a fast direct extension, and run away before the opponent's tip comes forward. This sort of attack brings the attacker's target close, while their arm is pulling back.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a name="late"></a><h2>Late-arriving hand attack</h2> <center><EMBED  							SRC="videos/foil/The_late_arriving_att.mov"  							WIDTH="240" HEIGHT="196"  							AUTOPLAY="false"  							CONTROLLER="true"  							TARGET="myself"  							PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">  						</EMBED> </center> <p>In this action, fencer right completes her lunge, but delays her extension.

She doesn't find the parry  she swings at the air  because the attack has been withheld. <br><br> For many fencers who use this technique without thinking, this could be called a bad habit. The moment it gets predictable, it's a severe liability. Used here, and at this moment, it's a very sophisticated and effective way of disjoining hand tempo and foot tempo.<br><br></p>  <a name="verylate"></a><h2>Very, very late arriving attack</h2> <center><EMBED  							SRC="videos/foil/Very_late_arr_att.mov"  							WIDTH="240" HEIGHT="196"  							AUTOPLAY="false"  							CONTROLLER="true"  							TARGET="myself"  							PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">  						</EMBED> </center> <p>Just to mix things up, you can play with the signals you're giving to your opponent. <br><br> Here, fencer left showed a concluded attack to her opponent  the lunge was launched, the lunge landed.

The opponent took another few parries, but they were all guesswork. <br><br> Of course, this approach is dangerous when the opponent is not ready to be fooled.<br><br>Also note  when the extension finally comes from the left, it's very fast.

(The leaning is what does it, it removes her options for a counter-action.)<br><br>  Fencer right is really inviting her opponent. Having drawn a quickly thrown-together and badly constructed attack from her opponent, she picks up an easy parry riposte.<br><br>  This action is also under Decision Point marching  marches are invitations.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a name="closeout"></a><h2>Counter with close-out</h2><br /><center><EMBED SRC="videos/foil/stophit_closeout.mov" <br />WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="322" <br />AUTOPLAY="false" <br />CONTROLLER="true" <br />TARGET="myself" <br />PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"> <br /></EMBED> </center><br /><p><br />This action might also be called attack from left, parry riposte, touch right. Or, it could be attack from left, counter attack. For our needs, we'll call it attack from right.<br><br><br /><br />Close-outs are hybrid actions that go against the normal flow of bladework. Usually, a blade is either defending or attacking. Very occasionally, it can do both.<br><br><br /><br />In this action, fencer right attacks (or counter-attacks), while at the same time forcing the opponent's blade away from his target. It's not quite a prise de fer, which is (by definition) a preparation of attack, but it's almost the same thing. It would have been one if the action hadn't finished so quickly, but it did, so it gets its own name: the close-out.<br><br><br /><br />The close-out works best like any bind, when the strong part of your blade is against the weak part of the opponent's blade. When the opponent's blade is extended in line, as for an attack, it offers enough resistance so that you can catch it near your bell guard and slide along the blade back towards the opponent's target. Hence that short, metallic "slurp" sound.<br><br></p><br /><br /><a name="reallysimple"></a><h2>Simple attacks are simple</h2><br /><center><EMBED SRC="videos/foil/make_it_look_easy1.mov" <br />WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="322" <br />AUTOPLAY="false" <br />CONTROLLER="true" <br />TARGET="myself" <br />PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"> <br /></EMBED> </center><br /><p>Every now and then, simple attacks are <i>really simple.</i> After a fencer has practiced committed attacks and hesitation attacks, fast and slow attacks, safe and risky attacks&hellip; after they've run the gamut, and practiced everything, they should remind themselves that attacks are about hitting the opponent. It is very easy to get caught up in the attack itself, and to see a good attack as the goal.<br><br><br /><br />It's not the kitchen, it's the food.<br><br />It's not the music, it's the mood.<br><br><br /><br />For attacks, the real goal is putting the point on the opponent. If you don't have to pop a tendon, or even break a sweat while doing it, so be it.<br><br><br /><br />In this action, fencer left advances towards his opponent. He doesn't look like he's in close distance, due in part to his raised hand. When he extends, he extends very close to his opponent's blade. Note the blade-sound as his opponent actually finds the parry and begins to move the tip away from his target. But it's too late  the distance is too close, and fencer left's tip is traveling forward faster than the parry is pushing it sideways. The result is a neat little touch, with very little sweat.<br /><br><br><br />This is just one touch, but at the right time, a simple attack like this can cause a spike in the defender's mental activity. He may think anything from, <i>I'm a fool!</i> to <i>What was I thinking?</i> to even, <i>Gee that guy is good!</i> While they're trying to pinpoint their feelings about what happened, the attacker gets a quiet glow of pride. A secondary goal, then, is to make everything you do look easy: It makes your opponent afraid, or at least a little morbid about their chances against you.<br><br></p><br /><br /><a name="beatgo"></a><h2>Beat-and-go simple attack</h2><br /><center><br /><EMBED SRC="videos/foil/simple_attack_gallop.mov" <br />WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="322" <br />AUTOPLAY="false" <br />CONTROLLER="true" <br />TARGET="myself" <br />PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"> <br /></EMBED> </center><br /><p>Fencer left gallops forward, gets into distance and makes a beat attack. <i>So what?</i><br><br><br /><br />There are similar looking attacks under Marching attacks, but this one has a different philosophical foundation. Generally speaking, marches are to get the opponent to make the wrong reaction. Simple attacks are to deprive the opponent of the <i>chance</i> to react. In Short march for longer lunge, for example, fencer left beats the blade, pauses for her opponent to make an early parry, and then hits on the other side. In <i>this</i> action, fencer left beats with the intent to hit <i>before</i> the opponent can do anything at all.<br /><br><br><br />This attack is also interesting because  as normal as it seems  simple beat attacks are not very common in low- and intermediate-level fencing. Study fencers at the lower level, and you'll see many beats that have no follow-up extensions at all, or beats followed by a pullback of the hand (there's some of that in this action). When extensions happen, they are late, or slow, or ambiguous about target, as if the fencer didn't have the target already selected prior to the beat.<br><br><br /><br />Crummy beat-attacks happen for many reasons. The fencer might be beating, and then looking to see what target was opened. The fencer's beat might have been made with the whole arm (rather than just a spank of the blade originating from the wrist), and so it takes a while to bring the point back around to target. Or the fencer might simply have no confidence in the felicity of a beat-and-go, because&hellip; well&hellip; it's so simple, how could it work?<br /><br><br><br />Eventually, every newcomer figures out that fencing isn't about complex actions, but rather simple actions. The simple actions score the points, and few things are simpler than a beat attack. Sure, fencing is complex, but the complexity is built out of simple things, like a house is built out of bricks.</p>|Simple attacks are just that: simple, fast, easy. They rely on surprise to hit, because if there's no surprise, then the defender can defend against simple attacks with simple defense.<br><br> By "surprise," we mean change in tempo. If a fencer's attack is all fast, it won't be surprising; if the attack is all slow, it won't be surprising. If it's fast then slow, or slow then fast, it will surprise the opponent.<br><br> Definitionally, "simple" attacks are direct attacks. For our purposes, we include all one- and two-part attacks that aren't marching attacks.<br><br> <b>Actions:</b><br> <table class="w"><tr><td><a href="#carry">Carrying through the simple attack</a><br><a href="simpleattacks.php?start_from=1&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=&#sfs">Simple, fast, and short = safe</a><br><a href="simpleattacks.php?start_from=1&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=&#tempo">Tempo to launch attack</a><br><a href="simpleattacks.php?start_from=2&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=&#open">Opening up the opponent for delivery</a><br><a href="simpleattacks.php?start_from=3&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=&#counter">Counter-attacking against simple attacks</a><br><a href="simpleattacks.php?start_from=3&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=&#hesitation">Hesitation Tempo Attack</a><br><a href="simpleattacks.php?start_from=4&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=&#verylate">Very, very late arriving attack</a><br><a href="simpleattacks.php?start_from=5&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=&#closeout">Counter with close-out</a><br><a href="simpleattacks.php?start_from=5&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=&#beatgo">The beat-and-go</a></td><td><a href="#power">Power attack</a><br><a href="simpleattacks.php?start_from=1&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=&#slow">Slower with distance = safe</a><br><a href="simpleattacks.php?start_from=2&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=&#speed">Change in speed</a><br><a href="simpleattacks.php?start_from=2&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=&#prep">Attack into preparation</a><br><a href="simpleattacks.php?start_from=3&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=&#tall">Against tall opponents</a><br><a href="simpleattacks.php?start_from=4&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=&#late">Late-arriving hand attack</a><br><a href="simpleattacks.php?start_from=4&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=&#invite">Draw the simple attack</a><br><a href="simpleattacks.php?start_from=5&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=&#reallysimple">Simple attacks can be simple</a></td></tr></table><br><br></p>  <a name="carry"></a><h2>Carry through the attack</h2> <center><EMBED SRC="videos/foil/direct_attack_nice.mov"  WIDTH="320" HEIGHT="256"  AUTOPLAY="false"  CONTROLLER="true"  TARGET="myself" PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">  </EMBED></center> <p>In this action, Fencer Right comes off the <i>on guard </i>line with an advance and a lunge -- and scores! This action is from the 2003 World Championships, and both competitors can do much, much more complicated fencing. But a straight attack was all that was needed, and the straight attack works.<br><br>Sometimes, the simple attacks land for no good reason. When simple attacks seem unsafe, irrational, and ill-advised, this is one of the best times to use them -- the opponent isn't expecting it.<br><br>Then again, simple attacks are usually easy to defend against.

With a simple attack, what the defender sees is what the defender gets&hellip; which is the way defenders like it.<br><br>If you're going to attack simple, make it surprising and <i>make it land</i>. Accelerate faster than the opponent can move, and hit through the parry. The main aspect of this action is that fencer right attacked with utter conviction and commitment.

Be introduced to the history and sport of fencing<br /> 2. Practice skills and techniques<br /> 3. Compete against each other and in tournaments<br /><br />The course will be a combination of lecture and &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; collaborative learning. Lecture will cover basic principles of fencing, including history and application of the sport, as well as various topics such sports psychology and fencing as art. The fundamentals will be taught to novice fencers, with more advanced techniques taught to students with prior fencing knowledge. Special attention will be placed on bout technique and theory of the sport. Collaborative learning will take place with open bouts among students.<br /> <br />No prior experience is necessary. Interested students must complete an application prior to enrolling for the class. CCN/CECs will be given to those who are accepted. <br /><br /><h2>Attendance Policy</h2><br />Each student is allowed two excused absences.

1281506226|fencing|Club Information|<p> Fencing is deeply rooted in Cal athletic tradition, with a team existing in some form since the founding of the school (it's the oldest club!).The sport itself dates back much further, and can be counted as one of the longest-practiced combat disciplines in history. Fencing today is a fast-paced and challenging sport at the same time, it is accessible to a wide range of ages and stylistically can be tailored to all levels of athleticism.<br> Fencing matches (or "bouts") are competed one-on-one, using one of three weapons: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foil_(fencing)">foil</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epee_(fencing)">epee</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabre_(fencing)">sabre</a>. The weapons differ in build, rules, and target area for scoring, so different techniques and strategies exist for each. For example, foil and epee can only score touches with the tip of the blade, while the sabre can score touches with the entire length and tip. Additionally, foil and sabre are governed by the system of "right of way" to determine priority in simultaneous touches, but these rules are not included in epee fencing.<br><br />The Cal Fencing Club is home to fencers of all three weapons. <br /></p><br /><p><br />The Cal Fencing Club is part of the Cal Sport Club Program and competes in the Northern California Intercollegiate Fencing League. Anybody can join, including community members.

After entering the RSF, turn left and go past the treadmills to find the Combatives Room right next to the Martial Arts Room.<br><br> <b>What should I wear? What about equipment?</b><br> Come in athletic clothing that allows you to move freely. Come to practice wearing long pants, a t-shirt, thick socks, and athletic shoes. Any light shoe will be fine, but the flatter the sole the better. Note: Long pants (sweat pants, warmups, etc.) or knickers are mandatory for all fencers. For beginners, we have all the gear you will need. Those who already own gear can bring it and store it in the club armory.<br><br> <b>Does it hurt?</b><br> Though it may look dangerous, fencing is one of the safest sports around, and is often said to be safer than golf!<br><br> <b>How much are dues?</b><br> Cost shouldn't keep you from fencing at Berkeley - dues are $120 per semester or $190 for an entire academic year, which is an awesome deal when many private clubs charge over $100 a month.<br><br> <br /><b>Can I take fencing for units?</b><br />Yes!  The Fencing Decal is back for Spring 2014!  <br><br /><a href="http://www.decal.org/courses/2896"> Click Here for more Information </a><br /><br /><br><br> <b>Why is practice so late?</b><br> Apparently, aerobics and hip hop dance are cooler than fencing...but the later practices are really not as bad as they sound. If you're concerned about the late walk home, there are groups of people going in all directions after practice. Talk to an officer to help find someone going the same way.<br><br> <b>Where can I learn more?</b><br> The USFA (United States Fencing Association) is our main governing body. They have excellent resources for fencers of all ages.

He's hitting <i>through</i> the parry (which must've been especially frustrating to his opponent), but the concept is the same.{nl}<br><br>{nl}Fencer right decides he's going to score, and no wimpy parry is going to stop him. Of course, it helps that the attack is an arc attack (flicky), which can wrap around an idle parry. Still, what sells the point is his commitment. He attacks into a closed line, which keeps his opponent from being worried  and then he <i>finishes</i> the attack, whereon his opponent finds that his defense was insufficient.<br><br>{nl}{nl}A committed attack can make late, laggardly, hesitant, or insufficient parries irrelevant.{nl}<br><br>{nl}This action is also under Concepts and <a href="simpleattacks.php">Simple attacks</a>.<br><br></p>{nl}{nl}<a name="remise"></a><h2>Parried?

You have touches to earn, screaming to do, medals to collect. With the right opponent, and at the right time, you can occasionally grab a sleazy remise despite a parry (and even a riposte) from the opponent.{nl}<br><br>{nl}This works best when your opponent is not positioned to land a riposte, because then, of course, you won't get hit. In the clip, fencer right is moving backwards  he tries for a riposte, but can't reach. The attacker (left) has a decent amount of speed left over from his parried attack, and he <i>can</i> reach.{nl}<br><br>{nl}For fencer right, it comes down to a judgement call. Based on the fencer's experience and the feeling of the action, the fencer must decide between a half-hearted riposte, or a more conservative parry-no-riposte approach. If fencer right could do it over, he would have parried, waited, parried again and riposted. Or  he would have made darn sure to land his tip.<br><br>{nl}{nl}There is another immediate remise (also known as <i>appuntata</i>) under Tricks, Tactics and Strategy.<br><br></p>{nl}{nl}<a name="goaround"></a><h2>Invite a parry and go around</h2>{nl}<center><EMBED {nl}							SRC="videos/foil/attack_hilo.mov" {nl}							WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="322" {nl}							AUTOPLAY="false" {nl}							CONTROLLER="true" {nl}							TARGET="myself" {nl}							PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"> {nl}						</EMBED> </center>{nl}<p>{nl}Fencer left beats the blade and moves forward, hand high. The opponent falls back, seeing the fencer's high tip.{nl}<br><br>{nl}That tip isn't threatening target, not really (and the hand is quite withdrawn). It's <i>implying</i> a threat to an area of target; it's merely <i>suggesting</i> where the tip can end up. It's hovering in the air, and it can score against the shoulder, the back, the breast, the flank. In effect, fencer left is <i>reducing the options</i> of her opponent.<br><br>{nl}{nl}That's what these vague tip movements do  they supress opponents. Whatever the opponent does must factor in the vague implied threat. In the same way, if your dog rests his chin on the coffee table close to your pile of oreos, you're going to move the oreos away. Not that anything would happen&#8230; but why not be safe?{nl}<br><br>{nl}As fencer left charges closer, her opponent's hand gets higher. The threat to the high line never really manifests (and it's never really a feint), and so the defender never really commits to a parry. That's fine  the best way to beat an opponent's parry is to never tell them they need one. Eventually, when her opponent's hand is high enough, fencer left hits the open low-line target.<br><br>{nl}{nl}An action like this is not a feint disengage per se. It's more like showing a flaw, so the opponent buys into it and doesn't do anything unexpected. The story is this: "My tip is high, so I'll probably attack high. My hand is pulled, which shows I have little confidence in this one. Why don't you move your hand higher to counter my threat? Clearly I haven't thought this one through."<br><br></p>{nl}{nl}<a name="machinegun"></a><h2>Machine-gun through the parry</h2>{nl}<center><EMBED {nl}							SRC="videos/foil/searching_ateos.mov" {nl}							WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="322" {nl}							AUTOPLAY="false" {nl}							CONTROLLER="true" {nl}							TARGET="myself" {nl}							PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"> {nl}						</EMBED> </center>{nl}<p>{nl}Fencer right is chased to the end of the strip, but does nothing to actively end the action.

He knows that this ludicrous end-of-strip frenzy will not last for long. He finishes it quickly and dodges away. It's easy to defeat a parry when there's never a riposte.

It's difficult to execute against high-level fencers who spend years building omniscient parries. It's also the first thing discarded under pressure by a fencer, who must often sacrifice control and wit for speed. <br><br> Fencer left is across from a German, and knows the Germans' predilection for sweeping parries. She executes the safest kind of deception there is, a low-high attack, which draws her opponent into trying to find the parry at the expense of distance.<br><br>  (The term disengage used to mean <i>un-engaging</i> the blade, as from an engaged position. Nowadays, it's used almost interchangeably with the term deceive. <i>Drobement</i> also means the same thing, but in the context of an extended arm, say with a Point in Line. These are all ways of <i>Refusing the Blade</i>  yet another term for avoiding the opponent's actions on the blade, and thankfully one that we don't use anymore.)<br><br></p>  <a name="disengage"></a><h2>A tiny disengage is all you need</h2> <center><EMBED  							SRC="videos/foil/wicked_disengage.mov"  							WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="322"  							AUTOPLAY="false"  							CONTROLLER="true"  							TARGET="myself"  							PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">  						</EMBED> </center> <p>Fencer left chases her opponent down, unleashing a lunge at the end of her attack. This all seems quite manageable, to fencer right. She eventually stops retreating, makes a parry, and leans into the attack.<br><br>  But the whole nature of the action changes when fencer left throws in a final disengage. Her low attack draws a parry 8 from her opponent, but fencer left has already changed her attack to the high line. She catches her opponent so off guard that it takes a moment for her to be able to extricate her blade after the action. <br><br> Small, precise movements like this often <i>seem</i> more difficult than they are. When a fencer can reign in the urge to make big, sweeping movements, their tips will stay nearer to the opponents' targets. This makes the target easier to hit. In this action, it's a simple matter for fencer left to put her point on target, even when fencer right is closing distance, ducking, and trying to parry.<br><br></p>  <a name="prise"></a><h2>Strong hand prise - ignore the parry</h2> <center><EMBED  							SRC="videos/foil/strong_hand_prise.mov"  							WIDTH="320" HEIGHT="256"  							AUTOPLAY="false"  							CONTROLLER="true"  							TARGET="myself"  							PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">  						</EMBED> </center> <p>Fencer right knows, from prior actions in the bout, that her opponent has a weak wrist.

There is not enough strength in her opponent's wrist to make the counter-parry work. Note how fencer left's hand raises during the counter-parry (as if to make a desperate 4), but her blade is already captured.<br><br>  Fencer right keeps ahold of her opponent's blade, and uses the strength of her fort against the weakness of her opponent's foible. She hits fencer left during and in spite of left's attempt. It's a judicious application of strength that works wonderfully.</p>|||15||||

They don't need to be. If your distance is good, then parries are almost unnecessary. They are merely added insurance against an attack which has already been handled.

It's only when these fencers close distance that the urgency reaches their hands.<br><br>  If the distance is bad, then your hand has one setting only: As fast as possible, because you're always fixing emergencies. Since surprise is generated by change, then a hand that always moves as fast as possible is not surprising but rather predictable. It's much better to have a hand that can change when you need it to: Slow fast, fast slow.

The flank itself sometimes seems small, but with the vagaries of movement in the bout, it can actually extend from the hip to the shoulder. A whole swath of target that can only be protected by the comparatively weak 6 and 8 parries.

If your attack is parried, there's always time (or it often seems like there's time) to take a counter-parry, if you're quick and prepared.<br><br>  Fencer left is launching an attack, feeling pretty ready for anything. What comes, however, is a complete surprise. The close-out disposes of the normal back-and-forth rhythm. The parry is the riposte, it happens in one move. Add to that a sudden closing of distance, and an esquive, and you have a situation where that attacking fencer's tip is leveraged into space, and the attacker impales on the opponent's blade.<br><br>  Closeouts aren't always easy to do. First, you need your opponent to commit to a certain target, not only so you can find the blade but so you can get leverage against it when you do find it. Then, when you take the blade, you must take it fort against foible (the closer to your bell guard the better), so that the more the opponent extends to hit, the further away from your target their tip goes. Then, you have to be ready with distance, so that you're not too far away to hit. Once all that is achieved, the actual close-out movement is a simple matter of riding the opponent's blade back up to their target.<br><br>  In this clip, fencer right takes a slightly different approach. She puts the point on target, and finding her blade close to her opponent's, closes out afterwards.</p>|||15|||use_html=1|

If you fade before a long attack, you might get a good opportunity, or you might not. Good marching attacks can be stretched, or attenuated, to eat up all the distance a fading fencer gives. So the fade is one tactic against the march, but not a killer tactic. If there was a killer tactic against the march, they wouldn't be so useful.<br><br>  Fading back isn't merely retreating before the opponent's attack. Merely retreating doesn't defer confrontation at all  rather, it buys right into the march, which requires that the defensive fencer runs away while searching for a parry. Fading back is <i>controlled</i> retreating, done while keeping composure and maintaining safe distance so that the fading fencer doesn't have to worry about any part of the march.</p>|||16||||

Had fencer right attacked, it would have been his right of way.<br><br></p>  <a name="targetmarch"></a><h2>Changing targets on the march</h2> <center><EMBED  							SRC="videos/foil/March_change_target.mov"  							WIDTH="240" HEIGHT="196"  							AUTOPLAY="false"  							CONTROLLER="true"  							TARGET="myself"  							PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">  						</EMBED> </center> <p>The cool thing about doing marching attacks is that you can see when the defender commit to a course of action. As long as you keep your wits about you, you can predict the opponent's attack on your preparation. <br><br> The point where the opponent decides to do something is the <i>decision point</i>. Decision points are useful to fencers on the march, because even if they don't finish with a hit, marches can elicit a useful response. <br><br> In this action, fencer right charges forward, and draws an attack from her opponent. Seeing the the opponent's decision, fencer right picks her target and finishes in time  ahead of the stop hit.</p>|||16||||

He starts with a symbolical beat to indicate his attack. He starts forward with a relaxed, slow gallop, his blade-feints big and only vaguely threatening. At this stage the attack is still something of an invitation; fencer left is ready with a second-intention action, should fencer right attack his preparation. <br><br> As fencer right retreats back past his center line, fencer left starts accellerating. At this stage, the invitation phase is over, and the march starts becoming a real attack. Now that he's walked the opponent out of his distance, fencer left knows that a faster action will start to draw parries. Fencer right's hand starts moving from threat to threat, and though he does a good job of keeping composure, his hand is soon useless for defense. <br><br> Finally fencer left finishes with a comfortable little lunge, stands up, turns around. One light, and it felt like an audience demo. <br><br> This is the march as it's supposed to be. The attacker controls the whole action, the attack feels inevitable, the point arrives with barely any blade contact. The march is uniquely frustrating and demoralizing to opponents who don't know how to fight against it. Sometimes these attacks can be so easy they're like sleepwalking. Fencer left might be wondering why his opponent didn't contest his marching attack, but he's not about to complain. <br><br> As soon as fencer right learns to fight the march, then the fun, complicated fencing begins. <i>Decision point</i>, baby.<br><br></p>  <a name="marchdown"></a><h2>March down your opponent like a dog</h2> <center><EMBED  							SRC="videos/foil/attackm_marchdown.mov"  							WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="322"  							AUTOPLAY="false"  							CONTROLLER="true"  							TARGET="myself"  							PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"> </EMBED></center> <p>When you march down an opponent, the opponent may use one of the techniques to break your march. When you find an opponent who can't, or won't defend against marches, enjoy it! They're sitting ducks! The next fencer might make you work.<br><br>  Fencer right gallops forward, grabbing distance, showing feint after feint. His opponent doesn't do anything to defend or counter his approach. Fencer right eventually dispenses with the advances  he switches to crossovers which are less safe but easier on the legs. He stops feinting, since it doesn't make any difference  he leaves his hand elevated. Fencer right has realized that the action is his, and there's very little he could do against this fencer to lose it.<br><br>  This is not very flattering for fencer left&#8230; but then again, he's the guy who bought tickets to Shanghai, China, so he could get schooled in the semi-finals. (He doesn't really get schooled.) Breaking up a marching attack is merely one skill every fencer must have, and it starts with recognizing the attack. Fencer left needed to think: "Jeesh, a marching attack. How low-rent. Okay let's take this baby over." Fencer left never seems to recognize how he's being attacked, and so he gives ground and waits passively for something to parry. Of all the reactions to a march, this is the one the march finds most nutritious.<br><br></p>  <a name="safemarch"></a><h2>Marches make for safe attacks</h2> <center><EMBED  							SRC="videos/foil/attackm_safe.mov"  							WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="322"  							AUTOPLAY="false"  							CONTROLLER="true"  							TARGET="myself"  							PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">  						</EMBED> </center> <p>In other clips, we mention how marches are used to wear down an opponent, and how they're used to invite a reaction from the opponent. In these situations, actually scoring is a secondary purpose of the march. It's nice when it happens, but it wasn't the reason for building the march in the first place. <br><br> But occasionally the march will conclude as a march. In the clip above, fencer left gets his opponent moving backwards. The lunge, when it appears, is long and reachy, rather than fast and decisive. Even if his opponent had found the parry and offered a riposte, fencer left would have <i>still</i> been safe. This is because fencer right was moving backwards too quickly to be able to hit. <br><br> If you get your opponent running away fast enough, you may not hit, but you probably won't <i>get</i> hit. <br><br> There is more about "safe" attacks under <a href="simpleattacks.php">Simple Attacks</a>.<br><br></p> <a name="oldschool"></a> <h2>The old-school march</h2> <center><EMBED  							SRC="videos/foil/Romankov_March.mov"  							WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="322"  							AUTOPLAY="false"  							CONTROLLER="true"  							TARGET="myself"  							PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">  						</EMBED> </center> <p>Romankov (left) has discovered that his opponent will give ground when he makes preparations. <br><br> He quickly uses this fact to start a series of abortive preparations. The opponent obligingly falls back. When the opponent is sufficiently "opened up"  his composure lost, or his mind confused  Romankov finishes with a simple lunge.<br><br>  The real lunge doesn't look much different from the rest of Romankov's preparations. It takes a moment for fencer right to understand that that real attack has commenced  and by then it's too late!</p>|||16||||
