Cal Fencing website total overhaul. I don't really know web dev (yet), this will be really basic.

To-do
-----
* center things
* add padding to navbar. Changing to "fixed" doesn't work because it kills the responsiveness.
* Get photos for home and team carousels, and probably a better one for the header
* Change CSS so there is a max width of text. Looks weird when maximized on a large screen.
* Add social media thingies
* Add custom 404 page
* Figure out how to do announcements/blog (Integrate a wordpress blog?)
