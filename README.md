Cal Fencing website overhaul.

To-do
-----
* Figure out how to do announcements/blog (Integrate a wordpress blog?)
* center things
* Get photos for home and team carousels, and probably a better one for the header
* Add social media thingies
* Add custom 404 page
* double check responsive elements (navbar is not responsive for small devices?)
